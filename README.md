Interactive Survey Interface
A streamlined web application for conducting user research surveys with image rating capabilities. 

The interface combines user authentication, consent collection, and multi-stage evaluation forms in a single-page application.

This application provides a complete survey workflow starting with user login, followed by demographic data collection and consent forms, then proceeding to an image rating system where users evaluate content across multiple criteria. 

The interface includes severity rating scales, categorization options, and open-ended feedback collection. All data is captured client-side and can be submitted as a complete dataset.
